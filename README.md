# Solutions to cryptopals.com in Golang.
These were written and tested entirely from a Chromebook, using the [Official Go](https://play.golang.org/) and [repl.it](https://repl.it/) online sandboxes. Therefore, they also do not read in from separate files or leverage importing a set of utilities defined in another file.

To run a solution, simply paste the entire solution text in one of these sandboxes and run.

Note that in a couple of circumstances, the official site wasn't respecting my print statements for debugging. Unclear reasons.
